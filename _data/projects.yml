- name: Base Placement Planning for Object Grasping
  descr: "RoboCup competition task which led us to achieve 2nd position worldwide at Heart-MET robotics competition 2023. To plan an optimal trajectory for the robot to grasp an object (selected through hand gestures). Developed algorithm using Open3D library and machine learning techniques for processing 3d point cloud which considers optimal trajectory criteria"
